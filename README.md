The Official Website for Hardcore Anarchy.

Hardcore Anarchy is a minecraft server where when you die, you will be automatically banned for 24 hours.
This is to create a more intense environment, but one without the risk of permadeath but still makes deaths, no matter the manner, more impactful, giving your in-game life more value.

There are no rules, you can play with hacked clients, steal, grief, exploit, and kill, However any purposeful attempts to lag, damage, infiltrate, or take control of server hardware and/or software will be severely punished.

There is an in game currency know as "revive credits" these credits allow you to respawn upon death without being banned, provided you have one. New players start out with 2 revive credits, therefore 3 lives.
